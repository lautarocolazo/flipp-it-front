# Overview - Flippit

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
This project is a website allowing the user to create, study, and save digital flashcards. The website uses a database to store account information and users' flashcards. This is a useful resource for learning new material and languages.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
